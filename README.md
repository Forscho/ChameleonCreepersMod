# Chameleon Creepers

![](http://i.imgur.com/UBvb4Mq.png)

## Description
Creepers were actually intimidating in Alpha when the grass was that familiar vivid green, but ever since biomes were introduced, their color remained the same.
Creepers are very easy to spot and therefore very easy to avoid. This mod aims to fix that, by changing their colors depending on their surroundings

Bug reports, feedback and feature requests welcome :)
